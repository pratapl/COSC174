% Inputs:  
% Xtrain:  [m x n] 
% Xtest:   [l x n]
% mode:    'string', can be ['artist', 'track', 'user', 'rating', 'time']
               
% Output:
% avg:     [l x 1], vector containing the average rating for the group

% this function takes in one or more examples, loops through Xtrain and
% matches the feature specified by 'mode' and groups all examples in Xtrain 
% that have matching features. The average track rating is then taken for 
% the group and output.
